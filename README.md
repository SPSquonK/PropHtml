# Express Prop Items

Express Prop Items is a project that aims to expose the prop item files from
FlyFf in a webpage to make easier seeing and editing the items.

The project is based on [PropHtml](https://github.com/SPSquonK/PropHtml/tree/ca8792923f5a7bbe243a010ef0829095dcc5c4ae),
a project that did the same, but in Python. As I think that the programming
of PropHtml was hell and it was not maintained, I prefer to remake this project
in JavaScript.

The current goal is to support the same features as PropHtml.

## Getting started

### Configuration

Node.js and npm are required. If you haven't succumbed to the powers of the
light side, https://nodejs.org/en/ might help you.

- `npm install`
- Modify the .env to point to your resources.

Currently, only a clean V15 source is supported. SFlyFF and V21 sources
will be supported later.

### Usage

- `node index.js` will start the server.
- Go on `http://localhost:3000`
